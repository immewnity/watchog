A work-in-progress project. Ultimately, the goal is to create a bot that will:

# Perform a GET request on a given URL
## Custom headers maybe too
## Session control?
# Parse the data from the response
## HTML/XML/JSON/PDF/?
# Store as a snapshot
# Compare to previous snapshot
# If different, send an alert
## Email/push notification/webhook

With the following features:

* Run change checks at user-provided intervals, customizable per URL
* Run change checks manually
